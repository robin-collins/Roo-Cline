I'll analyze the code and identify potential issues with the configuration profile management. Let me break down what I see:

**Core Issues Identified:**

1. **State Management and Profile Switching:**
   In `ConfigManager.ts`, there are several methods that handle configuration profiles:

- `SaveConfig(name, config)` - Saves a specific configuration
- `SetCurrentConfig(name)` - Sets which config is active
- `LoadConfig(name)` - Loads a specific configuration

The issue likely stems from how the state is managed between these operations, particularly:

- The configuration data is stored as a single object with all profiles
- The current profile name is stored alongside the profiles themselves
- There's no clear separation between "current working state" and "saved profile state"

2. **UI State Management:**
   In `ApiConfigManager.tsx` and `SettingsView.tsx`, the UI components maintain their own state of the current configuration. When changes are made, they're immediately reflected in the UI state but the saving mechanism might not properly isolate changes to the specific profile.

**Root Cause:**
The core issue appears to be that when saving a profile, the code might be:

1. Taking the entire current application state rather than just the profile-specific settings
2. Not properly isolating profile-specific settings from global settings
3. Not properly handling the transition between editing different profiles

**Proposed Solution Plan:**

1. **State Isolation:**

    - Create a clear separation between "working state" and "saved profiles"
    - Implement a proper state management pattern that tracks:
        - Current working configuration
        - Currently selected profile name
        - Saved profiles (as immutable objects)

2. **Profile Management:**

    - Modify `SaveConfig` to:
        - Only save profile-specific settings
        - Create a clear schema of what belongs in a profile vs. global settings
        - Validate the configuration before saving
    - Add proper profile switching logic that:
        - Saves current changes before switching (or prompts user)
        - Loads clean profile state when switching
        - Prevents unintended state mixing

3. **Data Structure Changes:**

    ```typescript
    interface GlobalConfig {
    	currentApiConfigName: string
    	globalSettings: GlobalSettings
    	profiles: {
    		[key: string]: ApiConfiguration
    	}
    }
    ```

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   a. Create proper type definitions for profile-specific vs. global settings
   b. Modify the config manager to:

    - Add methods for profile state management
    - Add validation for profile operations
    - Add proper state isolation
      c. Update the UI components to:
    - Handle profile switching properly
    - Maintain clean state separation
    - Add proper save/load/switch workflows

5. **Profile Operations Workflow:**

    ```
    When Switching Profiles:
    1. Save current profile state if modified
    2. Clear working state
    3. Load new profile into working state
    4. Update UI

    When Saving Profile:
    1. Validate changes
    2. Extract profile-specific settings
    3. Update only that profile's data
    4. Maintain other profiles unchanged
    ```

This solution would maintain proper isolation between profiles and prevent the cross-contamination of settings between different profiles. The key is to treat each profile as an immutable object until explicitly modified, and to maintain clear boundaries between global state, working state, and saved profiles.
