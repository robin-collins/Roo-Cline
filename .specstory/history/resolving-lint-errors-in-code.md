can you please resolve these lint errors

I'll help resolve these lint warnings by removing the unused imports and variables. Let me check the contents of these files first.

I'll fix these lint warnings by removing unused imports and variables. Let me make the necessary edits:

1. First, let's fix `ApiConfigManager.tsx`:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
import { memo, useState } from "react"
import { ApiConfigMeta } from "../../../../src/shared/ExtensionMessage"
import { ApiConfiguration } from "../../../../src/shared/api"
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_

2. Now, let's fix `ApiOptions.tsx`:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
// ... existing code ...
	const { apiConfiguration: extensionStateApiConfiguration, setApiConfiguration, uriScheme } = useExtensionState()
	const [ollamaModels, setOllamaModels] = useState<string[]>([])
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_

I've made the following changes to resolve all the lint warnings:

1. In `ApiConfigManager.tsx`:

    - Removed unused imports: `VSCodeButton`, `VSCodeTextField`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`
    - Kept only the necessary imports: `memo` and `useState`

2. In `ApiOptions.tsx`:
    - Removed unused destructured variables from `useExtensionState`: `onUpdateApiConfig`, `openRouterModels`, and `glamaModels`
    - Kept only the necessary variables: `extensionStateApiConfiguration`, `setApiConfiguration`, and `uriScheme`

All lint warnings should now be resolved. The code should work as before since we only removed unused imports and variables.

I'll fix the remaining lint warning in `ApiOptions.tsx` where `extensionStateApiConfiguration` is destructured but never used. Let me remove this unused variable:

undefined
